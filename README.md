# MCP Local Dev

A fully automated local development environment manager for MCP-connected Language Models. This groundbreaking tool enables any MCP-compliant LLM to manage development environments, run tests, execute shell commands, and more - all within safe, isolated sandboxes.

## üöÄ Highlights

- **Fully Automated**: Let your MCP-connected LLMs handle local development tasks autonomously
- **Safe Execution**: All operations run in isolated sandboxes
- **MCP Spec Compliant**: Complete implementation of the MCP specification with comprehensive test coverage
- **AI-Generated**: 98% of the codebase was written by Claude 3.5 Sonnet using [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider)
- **Open Development**: Full, unredacted Git history preserved for research and analysis

## ü§ñ An AI Development Experiment

This project stands as one of the few public examples of a non-trivial program being implemented almost entirely by an LLM with minimal human intervention. The complete Git history has been preserved to provide researchers and developers insights into the current state of AI-assisted development, including:

- Development patterns and "churn inefficiency"
- Regression patterns and recovery strategies
- Prompting techniques and context optimization
- Real-world examples of LLM-driven development workflows

## üìä Model Performance Analysis

During development, multiple LLM models were evaluated:

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Excellent performance, primary development model
- **DeepSeek V3**: Strong results, particularly with system-level operations
- **O1**: Poor performance, not recommended for this use case

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

1. Install the MCP Claude desktop client
2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/txbm/mcp-local-dev
cd mcp-local-dev
```
3. Configure your MCP environment:
```bash
mcp configure local-dev
```

## üõ† Command Reference

```bash
mcp local-dev init          # Initialize a new dev environment
mcp local-dev test         # Run test suite in sandbox
mcp local-dev shell        # Open interactive shell
mcp local-dev exec         # Execute command in sandbox
mcp local-dev clean        # Clean up sandbox environments
```

## üí° Key Insights

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Achieved incredible time-to-value for initial development
- **The 80/20 Rule Persists**: While LLMs excel at initial implementation, the final 15% refinement remains challenging
- **Context is King**: Success heavily dependent on providing models with:
  - MCP Python SDK source code
  - Third-party library documentation
  - Convention files and best practices
