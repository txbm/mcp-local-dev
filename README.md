## ✨ What's This?

A local development environment manager that lets LLMs configure and manage dev environments for you. Built for AI assistants to handle environment setup, dependency management, and testing automatically.

## 🏃 Quick Start

1. Install Claude Desktop from the [MCP quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)
2. Add the following to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "servers": {
     "local_dev": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/txbm/mcp-local-dev@main",
        "mcp-local-dev"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Point Claude at any GitHub repository and ask it to set up a dev environment!

## 💭 A Note on AI & Development

As someone who's spent years in software development, what's exciting about this project isn't just automation - it's the shift in how we interact with development environments. The value isn't in replacing human developers, but in reducing cognitive overhead. When AI handles environment setup and maintenance, developers can focus more on architecture and design decisions.

This project demonstrates that AI isn't just about generating code - it's about managing complexity. By handling the mechanical aspects of development environment setup, we free up mental bandwidth for the creative and architectural challenges that truly need human insight.
