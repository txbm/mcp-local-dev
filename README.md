# 🚀 MCP Local Dev

Supercharge your development workflow with AI-powered environment management! Let your MCP-connected LLMs handle the boring stuff while you focus on shipping code. 

## ✨ What's This?

A blazingly fast development environment manager for MCP-connected Language Models. Built with ❤️ by AI, for developers who want to move at lightspeed. 

## 🎯 Features That Slap

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Automation**: Full MCP Server spec compliance - your LLM is the captain now
- 🧪 **Smart Environments**: Path-isolated Python venvs, managed by UV for maximum speed
- ⚡️ **Multiple Runtimes**: First-class support for Node.js, Bun, and Python+UV
- 🛠️ **Zero Config**: Everything just works™️ - no more environment headaches
- 🔬 **AI Development Showcase**: 98% written by Claude 3.5 Sonnet using [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider)

## 🧮 The Numbers

Development involved rigorous testing across multiple models:
- 🏆 Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Crushed it
- 💪 DeepSeek V3: Strong performer
- 👎 O1: Not great, Bob

## 🏃 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Get the goods
git clone https://github.com/txbm/mcp-local-dev
cd mcp-local-dev

# 2. Set up MCP
mcp configure local-dev

# 3. Party time 🎉
```

## 🎮 Commands

```bash
mcp local-dev init          # Spin up a fresh env
mcp local-dev test         # Run your tests
mcp local-dev shell        # Jump into the shell
mcp local-dev exec         # Run a command
mcp local-dev clean        # Cleanup time
```

## 💫 Under the Hood

- **Path Isolation**: Each environment is neatly contained
- **System Requirements**: Uses your installed runtimes (Python, Node.js, Bun)
- **Network Access**: Full network connectivity for package management
- **Process Handling**: Native system processes - fast and efficient

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
