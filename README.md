# 🚀 MCP Local Dev

Let AI handle your local development environments while you focus on building amazing things!

## ✨ What's This?

A local development environment manager that lets LLMs configure and manage dev environments for you. Built with ❤️ by AI, for AI, for developers who want their LLM assistant to handle environment setup, dependency management, and testing automatically.

## 🎯 Features That Slap

- 🤖 **Pure AI Magic**: Just tell your LLM to set up a dev environment for any GitHub repo
- 🧪 **Full Auto**: Automatic dependency installation, environment setup, and test running
- ⚡️ **Multiple Runtimes**: First-class support for Node.js, Bun, and Python+UV
- 🛠️ **Zero Config**: Everything just works™️ - no more environment headaches

## 🧮 The Numbers

Development involved rigorous testing across multiple models:
- 🏆 Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Crushed it
- 💪 DeepSeek V3: Strong performer
- 👎 O1: Not great, Bob

## 🏃 Quick Start

1. Install Claude Desktop from the [MCP quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)
2. Follow the setup instructions to connect your local environment
3. Point Claude at any GitHub repository and ask it to set up a dev environment! 

## 💫 Under the Hood

- **MCP Server Spec**: Full compliance with comprehensive test coverage
- **Path Isolation**: Each environment is neatly contained
- **System Integration**: Uses your installed runtimes (Python, Node.js, Bun)
- **Package Management**: UV for blazing fast Python dependency installation
- **Network Access**: Full connectivity for package management
- **Process Handling**: Native system processes for maximum speed

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

This project demonstrates the incredible potential of AI-assisted development:
- 🏃‍♂️ Lightning fast prototyping
- 🎯 That last 15% is still where the real work happens
- 📚 Great example of real-world AI development patterns

## 💭 A Note on AI & The Future of Software

As a software engineer with 20+ years of production experience across firmware, systems, video games, distributed systems and frontend development, I'm incredibly excited about the future of LLM-assisted coding. This project isn't just a demo - it's a glimpse into how AI will augment and enhance the software engineering profession.

The potential is massive. We're looking at a future where AI helps us create software with capabilities and quality levels previously thought impossible. The global demand for software is infinite, and with AI assistance, we're better positioned than ever to meet that demand.

This isn't about replacement - it's about augmentation. Combining human expertise with AI capabilities opens up entirely new possibilities for what we can build and how quickly we can build it.
